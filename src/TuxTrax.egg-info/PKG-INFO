## Jam Like a Penguin: The Ubuntu-First Live Performance Sampler & Mixer

**TuxTrax** is a powerful, open-source live performance sampler and mixer, built from the ground up for Ubuntu and the vibrant Linux audio community. Embrace the spirit of Tux, the Linux penguin, and unleash your creativity with this powerful and versatile tool. Whether you're a seasoned DJ or just starting your musical journey, TuxTrax combines intuitive sampling, mixing, and performance features with cutting-edge AI-powered tools, providing everything you need to create captivating live soundscapes.

## Core Features - Assembled By Penguins

*   **Sampler Section:** Effortlessly import, slice, and manipulate samples with MIDI mapping for full expressive control.
*   **Mixer Section:** Craft polished mixes with analog-style channel strips, a pro-grade effects rack, and dynamic sidechain compression.
*   **Ubuntu-First Focus:** Experience exceptional low-latency performance thanks to our JACK Audio integration.

## Feature Highlights: From Ice Floe to Stage

### Sampler Section: Your Palette of Sound

*   **Multi-Sample Import:** Drag and drop WAV, MP3, and FLAC files, then automatically slice loops for rhythmic perfection.
*   **Smart Pitch/Time:** Manipulate tempo and pitch with ease. The Paulstretch algorithm delivers pristine time-stretching, while auto-tune helps lock your samples into perfect harmony.
*   **Sampler Modes:** Explore a range of modes:
    *   **One-Shot:** Perfect for percussive hits and short samples.
    *   **ADSR Envelopes:** Sculpt the dynamics of your sounds.

*   **Analog-Style Channel Strips:** Tweak levels, pan, and EQ on each channel for a polished, balanced mix. Choose from a variety of EQ styles to impart character and shape to your tracks.
*   **Pro Effects Rack:** Elevate your mixes with high-quality effects:
    *   **Inserts:** Inject warmth and character with the Tube Saturator, capture vintage vibes with Tape Emulation, or add digital grit with the Bitcrusher.
    *   **Sends:** Generate immersive sonic spaces with Convolution Reverb, build hypnotic rhythms with Analog Delay, or add swirling movement with Phaser, Chorus, Flanger, and Stutter effects.
*   **Sidechain Compression:** Add rhythmic pumping to your mix by ducking channels with kick drums or basslines.

## Pro Features: Evolve Your Sound

### AI-Powered Workflow: The Future of Sound
