*   **Suggestion:**
    *   **Add Style Guide Section:** Create a section on coding style and conventions.
    *   **Recommend PEP 8:** Recommend following PEP 8 for Python code.
    *   **Linters:** Mention any linters or formatters used (e.g., `flake8`, `black`).
    * **Example:**
        * **Coding Style:** We follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. Please use a linter like `flake8` to check your code before submitting a pull request. We also use `black` for code formatting.
* **Question:** Is there a coding style guide?

**2. Testing Guidelines:**

*   **Issue:** No mention of how to run tests or what kind of tests are expected.
*   **Suggestion:**
    *   **Testing Section:** Add a section on testing.
    *   **Test Framework:** Specify the testing framework used (e.g., `pytest`).
    *   **Running Tests:** Provide instructions on how to run the tests (e.g., `pytest` command).
    *   **Test Coverage:** Mention if there are any test coverage requirements.
    *   **Types of Tests:** Describe the types of tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).
    * **Example:**
        * **Testing:** We use `pytest` for testing. To run the tests, navigate to the root directory of the project and run `pytest`. Please ensure that your code is well-tested and that all tests pass before submitting a pull request. We aim for high test coverage.
* **Question:** How can I run the tests?

**3. Pull Request Template:**

*   **Issue:** No mention of a pull request template.
*   **Suggestion:**
    *   **Create Template:** Create a pull request template (e.g., `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`).
    *   **Template Content:** Include sections for:
        *   Description of changes
        *   Motivation
        *   Testing performed
        *   Screenshots (if applicable)
        *   Checklist (e.g., "I have run the tests," "I have updated the documentation")
    *   **Mention Template:** Mention the use of the template in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
    * **Example:**
        * **Pull Requests:** Please use the pull request template provided in the repository. This helps us to review your changes more efficiently.
* **Question:** Is there a pull request template?

**4. Branch Strategy:**

*   **Issue:** No mention of the branch strategy.
*   **Suggestion:**
    *   **Describe Strategy:** Add a section describing the branch strategy (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow).
    *   **Main Branch:** Specify the main branch (e.g., `main`, `develop`).
    *   **Feature Branches:** Explain how feature branches should be named.
    * **Example:**
        * **Branch Strategy:** We use a simplified version of Gitflow. The `main` branch contains the stable code. New features and bug fixes should be developed in separate feature branches, named `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/your-bug-fix`.
* **Question:** What is the used branch strategy?
