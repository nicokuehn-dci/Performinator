# TuxTrax Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing TuxTrax on Ubuntu, including system dependencies, virtual environment setup, and configuring PipeWire audio.

## System Dependencies

Before installing TuxTrax, ensure that your system has the necessary dependencies. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-venv python3-dev build-essential pipewire pipewire-audio-client-libraries libspa-0.2-jack pipewire-pulse qtbase5-dev libasound2-dev portaudio19-dev libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0 ffmpeg git curl
```

## Virtual Environment Setup

To keep your Python environment clean and organized, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. Follow these steps to set up a virtual environment for TuxTrax:

1. Clone the TuxTrax repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nicokuehn-dci/TuxTrax.git
    cd TuxTrax
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv daw_env
    source daw_env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuring PipeWire Audio

TuxTrax uses PipeWire for low-latency audio processing. Follow these steps to configure PipeWire on your system:

1. Install PipeWire and related packages:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y pipewire pipewire-audio-client-libraries libspa-0.2-jack pipewire-pulse
    ```

2. Add your user to the `audio` group to allow real-time audio processing:

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G audio $USER
    ```

3. Configure real-time audio permissions by adding the following lines to `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

    ```bash
    @audio - rtprio 99
    @audio - memlock unlimited
    ```

4. Reboot your system to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

## Configuring MIDI Devices

To configure MIDI devices, you can use `aconnect` and `amidi` tools.

### Listing MIDI Devices
To list available MIDI devices, run:
```bash
aconnect -i -o
amidi -l
```

### Connecting MIDI Devices
To connect a MIDI input to a MIDI output, use:
```bash
aconnect <input_id> <output_id>
```
Replace `<input_id>` and `<output_id>` with the appropriate IDs from the `aconnect -i -o` output.

## Configuring Recording Choices

To configure recording choices such as format and bitrate, you can use `arecord`.

### Listing Recording Devices
To list available recording devices, run:
```bash
arecord -l
```

### Setting Recording Format and Bitrate
To set the recording format and bitrate, use:
```bash
arecord -D plughw:<card_number>,<device_number> -f <format> -r <bitrate> -d <duration> <output_file>
```
Replace `<card_number>`, `<device_number>`, `<format>`, `<bitrate>`, `<duration>`, and `<output_file>` with the appropriate values.

## Running TuxTrax

Once you have completed the setup, you can start TuxTrax by running the following commands:

```bash
cd TuxTrax
source daw_env/bin/activate
python3 src/main.py
```
