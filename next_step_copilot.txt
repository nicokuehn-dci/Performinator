everything that is named elektron should be renamed cause of copyright stuff. name it : perftron. 
audio-sample library should be loaded from local machine, so add possibilities to choose library and remember location of it, 
so user could easily and fast load own samples to work with it. 
make it possible to export the actual samples that loaded into the sampler(8tracks) as an samplepack for performinator(if possible with own format log data).
